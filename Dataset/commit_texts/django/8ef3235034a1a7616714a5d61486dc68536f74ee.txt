Fixed #19720 -- Oracle ordering related delete regression

When a query had a complex where condition (a condition targeting more
than the base table) a subquery was used for deletion. However, the
query had default ordering from the model's meta and Oracle doesn't
work with ordered subqueries.

The regression was caused by fast-path deletion code introduced in
1cd6e04cd4f768bcd4385b75de433d497d938f82 for fixing #18676.

Thanks to Dylan Klomparens for the report.
