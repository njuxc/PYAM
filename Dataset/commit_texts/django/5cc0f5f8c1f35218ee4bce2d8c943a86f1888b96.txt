Made Query.clear_ordering force_empty arg mandatory

Previously it was possible to call clear_ordering without the
force_empty argument. The result was that the query was still ordered
by model's meta ordering if that was defined. By making the arg
mandatory it will be easier to spot possible errors caused by assuming
clear_ordering will remove all ordering.

Thanks to Dylan Klomparens for the suggestion. Refs #19720.
