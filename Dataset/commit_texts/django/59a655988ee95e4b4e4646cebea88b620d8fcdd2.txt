Fixed #13844 -- Avoid converting unknown db values to float

This patch removes an unconditional float(value) conversion from db
backend default convert_values() method. This can cause problems when
aggregating over character fields for example. In addition, Oracle
and SQLite already return the bare value from their convert_values().

In the long term the converting should be done by fields, and the
fields should then call database backend specific converters when
needed. The current setup is inflexible for 3rd party fields.

Thanks to Merlijn van Deen for the original patch.
