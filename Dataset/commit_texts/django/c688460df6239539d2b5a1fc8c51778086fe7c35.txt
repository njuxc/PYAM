Removed rmtree_errorhandler.

The stated reason for its introduction in d18d37ce no longer applies
since Django's code repository was switched from Subversion to git.

Furthermore it never had any effect because shutil.rmtree ignores its
onerror argument when ignore_errors is True.

The reason for its use in template management commands is unclear.
