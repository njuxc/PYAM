Applied latest changes to `ListMixin` from Aryeh Leib Taurog and added him to AUTHORS; fixed memory leak introduced in r10174 -- no longer call `ListMixin.__init__` and set methods manually because it created references that prevented garbage collection; fixed several routines that had no need to be class methods.
