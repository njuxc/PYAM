Fixed #20950 -- Instantiate OrderedDict() only when needed

The use of OrderedDict (even an empty one) was surprisingly slow. By
initializing OrderedDict only when needed it is possible to save
non-trivial amount of computing time (Model.save() is around 30% faster
for example).

This commit targetted sql.Query only, there are likely other places
which could use similar optimizations.
