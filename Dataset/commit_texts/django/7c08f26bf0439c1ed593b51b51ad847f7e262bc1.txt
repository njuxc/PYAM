Fixed #32260 -- Made View.as_view() do not use update_wrapper().

View.as_view() should not use update_wrapper() for copying attributes
it's unintended and have side-effects such as adding `self` to the
signature.

This also fixes system check for arguments of custom error handler
views with class-based views.
