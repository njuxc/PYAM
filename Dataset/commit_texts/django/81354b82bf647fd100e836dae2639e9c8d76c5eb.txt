Stopped calling apps.get_model with only_installed=False.

ContentTypes are only created for installed applications, and I could
make a case for not returning a model that isn't installed any more.
The check for stale ContentTypes in update_contenttypes doesn't use
model_class.

ModelSignal actually needs get_registered_model since the lookup happens
at import time. I took this opportunity to perform a small refactoring.
