Fixed #15272 -- Altered generic views to use the guaranteed untranslated object_name, rather than the possibly translated verbose_name(_plural) for default context objects. Thanks to szczav for the report and patch.

This is BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE for anyone relying on the default context object names for class-based Detail and List views. To migrate, either update your templates to use the new default names, or add a context_object_name argument to your generic views.
