Fixed connection.queries encoding handling on Oracle

In addition, removed a possibly problematic .filter() call from
backends.test_query_encoding test. It is possible the .filter could
cause collation problems on MySQL, and as it wasn't absolutely needed
for the test it seemed better to get rid of the call.
