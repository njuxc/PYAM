Updated MultiValueDict.update() to mirror dict.update() behavior.

Changes in behavior include:

- Accepting iteration over empty sequences, updating nothing.
- Accepting iterable of 2-tuples providing key-value pairs.
- Failing with the same or comparable exceptions for invalid input.

Notably this replaces the previous attempt to catch TypeError which was
unreachable as the call to .items() resulted in AttributeError on
non-dict objects.
