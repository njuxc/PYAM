Moved get_serializer() call in dumpdata command.

Moved the get_serializer() call within the condition that checks public
serializers.  This will allow exceptions other than
SerializerDoesNotExist to be raised in order to provide the caller with
useful information, e.g when pyyaml is not installed.
