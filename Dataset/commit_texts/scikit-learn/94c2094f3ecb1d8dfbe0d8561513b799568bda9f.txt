[MRG+1] BUG: MultiLabelBinarizer.fit_transform sometimes returns an invalid CSR matrix (#7750)

* BUG: MultiLabelBinarizer makes invalid CSR matrix

See https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/6719 for context.

The gist is that the `inverse` array may have a different dtype than `yt.indices`, which causes trouble down the line because, in those cases, `yt.indices` and `yt.indptr` have different dtypes.

Alternately, we could insert `yt.check_format(full_check=False)` after modifying the sparse matrix members.

* Fixing for old numpy

Older versions don't support kwargs for `astype`

* Adding tests

* line-wrapping

* adding comment to tests

[ci skip]

* added rationale comment
