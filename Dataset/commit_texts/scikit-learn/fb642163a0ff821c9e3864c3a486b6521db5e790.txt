[MRG+1] Affinity propagation edge cases (#9612) (#9635)

* Added test exposing non-convergence issues

As discussed in issue #9612, expecting cluster centers to be an empty array and labels to be
unique for every sample.

* Addresses non-convergence issues

Returns empty list as cluster center indices to prevent adding a dimension in fit() method,
returns unique labels for samples making this consistent with (TBD) predict() behavior for
non-convergence.

* Made predict() handle case of non-convergence while fitting

In this case, it will log a warning and return unique labels for every new sample.

* Added helper function for detecting mutually equal similarities and preferences

* Tidied imports

* Immediately returning trivial clusters and labels in case of equal similarities and preferences

* Simplified code for preference(s) equality test

* Corrected for failing unit tests covering case of n_samples=1

* Corrected for PEP8 line too long

* Rewriting imports to comply with max 80-column lines

* Simplified code

n_samples == 1 case does not need a separate return statement.

* Replaced logging warnings by warnings.warn()

Added assertions for warnings in tests.

* Marking function as non-public

* Using mask instead of modifying S

* Improvement suggested by review comment

* Avoided casting preference to array twice

* Readability improvements

* Improved returned labels in case of no cluster centers

Returning a unique label for every sample in X suggests that these were based on actual clusters.
Since there are no clusters, it makes more sense to return a negative label for all samples,
indicating there were no clusters.

* PEP8 line too long

* Avoided creating separate variable for preference as array

* Corrected warning message

* Making labels consistent with predict() behavior in case of non-convergence

* Minor readability improvement

* Added detail to test comment about expected result

* Added documentation about edge cases

* Added documentation to 'what's new'
