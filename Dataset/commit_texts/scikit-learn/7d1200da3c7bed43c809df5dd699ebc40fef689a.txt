Changed the default return type of ward_tree from bool to int

Changed the return type for ward_tree function from bool to int to avoid
an error when the parameter 'return_as' is set to 'numpy.ndarray', or when applying todense method to the sparse matrix returned.

fix : when edges is empty

added tests for grid_to_graph
