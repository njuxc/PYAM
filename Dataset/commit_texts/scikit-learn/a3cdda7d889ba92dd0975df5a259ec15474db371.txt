Fix bug in sparse k-NN and add disabled (!) test for sparse regression

Sparse regression doesn't work, but the test is there for the brave soul
that wants to implement it.

The bug caused Numpy dense matrices to be returned instead of arrays.
This didn't hurt the test or the doc. class. example, but it contradicts
the docstring.
