BUG Use epsilon threshold in `_samme_proba` and `_boost_real`

Instead of thresholding <0 probabilities to 1e-5, threshold <epsilon to epsilon. This avoids the issue of, e.g., probability values of 0 becoming larger than values of 1e-7.

Add a unit test for `_samme_proba` which checks that probability ordering is unchanged.

Resolves issue #4944 .
