OPTIM Lower memory usage of spectral_embedding.

When calling eigsh, -laplacian is given as an argument. Both laplacian
and -laplacian are thus in memory. By computing -laplacian inplace,
the extra copy is freed. This copy is not needed by the end of the
function call. The memory reclaimed is therefore available for the eigsh
call. In case of a RuntimeError, the laplacian is reverted to its old
value to process lobpcg as usual.
