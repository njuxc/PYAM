Fix stop_gradient inconsistent API (#7416)

The stop_gradient documentation states that the argument should be a list of
variables. The Theano implementation crashes if the argument is a list of
variables and the CNTK implementation crashes if it is not.

This commit handles both cases as can be expected.
