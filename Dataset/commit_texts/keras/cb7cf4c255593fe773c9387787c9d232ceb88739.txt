PR #50068: Change profiler dir to non-temporary in Keras TensorBoard callback

Imported from GitHub PR https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/50068

This is to fix the issue https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/49852.
Without the fix, the profiler dir will always be deleted for non-chief node under MWMS mode when Keras TensorBoard callback(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/TensorBoard) is used.
