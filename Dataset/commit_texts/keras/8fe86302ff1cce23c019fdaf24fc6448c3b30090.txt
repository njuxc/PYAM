Fix redundant functions' module names in auto-gen docs (#10664)

### Summary
This PR fixes the redundant function module names in auto-gen docs. Currently, the module name of functions (those which are not methods of a class) is repeated two times in documentation. [For example](https://keras.io/preprocessing/sequence/#pad_sequences):
> `keras.preprocessing.sequence.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences`

which should be: `keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences`.
Further, this PR also removes from the docs the (wrong) module name of methods of classes like `ImageDataGenerator`. For example, [this is for `apply_transform`](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/#apply_transform):

> `keras.preprocessing.image.apply_transform` 

which should simply be `apply_transform`, first because it is the method of a class (i.e. `ImageDataGenerator`) and second because the referenced module name is wrong (and this [has caused confusion](https://stackoverflow.com/q/51311062/2099607)).

All of this were caused by the fact that `clean_module_name()` was not called on the `function.__module__` in `render_function` (therefore this mostly affects the docs for `keras.preprocessing` and `keras.applications`). Plus, the way `autogen.py` works, the module name is repeated two times in the signature, but for the non-method functions it should be removed only once (that's why I have added a condition).
