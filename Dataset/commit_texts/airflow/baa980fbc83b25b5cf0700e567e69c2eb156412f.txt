When sending tasks to celery from a sub-process, reset signal handlers (#11278)

Since these processes are spawned from SchedulerJob after it has
registered it's signals, if any of them got signaled they would have the
behaviour of killing the ProcessorAgent process group! (MP has a default
spawn of fork on Linux, so they inherit all previous state -- signals,
and access to the `_process.pid` inside the ProcessorAgent instance)

This behaviour is not what we want for these multiprocess.Pool processes.

This _may_ be a source of the long-standing "scheduler is alive but not
scheduling any jobs. Maybe.
