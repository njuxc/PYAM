[AIRFLOW-6740] Remove Undocumented, deprecated, dysfunctional PROXY_FIX_NUM_PROXIES (#7359)

This parameter is deprecated by werkzeug, see:
https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/blob/0.16.1/src/werkzeug/middleware/proxy_fix.py#L113-L120

However, it is also broken. The value is acquired as string from the
config, while it should be int like the other `x_*` attributes. Those
were fixed in #6901, but `num_proxies` was forgotten.

I think we can safely remove it because:

* There is virtually no possibility that someone is using that parameter
  in their config without raising an exception.
* The configuration variable is not present in Airflow's docs or
   anywhere else anymore. The removed line is the only trace of it.
