When a task instance fails with exception, log it (#16805)

The previous .exception() call looks at sys.exc_info() for the active
exception, but since the failure handler is not in a Python exception
handling context, it fails to actually log the exception. This is
amended by passing in the exception instance explicitly, which is a
valid argument type according to logging's documentation.
