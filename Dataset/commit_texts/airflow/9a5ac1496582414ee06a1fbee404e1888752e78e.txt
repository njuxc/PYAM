Fix bug that backfill job fail to run when there are tasks run into reschedue state (#17305)

Backfill job fails to run when there are tasks run into rescheduling state. 
The error log as follows in issue #13322

```

```

The root cause is that the field `try_number` doesn't Increase when the task runs into rescheduling state, but there is a reduce operation on `try_number`. 

Currently, I can't think out a good ut to test it, only post the code here to help the one who is affected by it to solve the problem.
