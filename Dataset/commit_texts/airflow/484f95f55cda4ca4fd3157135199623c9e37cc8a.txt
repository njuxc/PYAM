Fix QueuedLocalWorker crashing with EOFError (#13215)

LocalExecutor uses a multiprocessing.Queue to distribute tasks to the
instances of QueuedLocalWorker. If for some reason LocalExecutor exits
(e.g. because it encountered an unhandled exception), then each of the
QueuedLocalWorker instances that it manages will also exit while trying
to read from the task queue.

This obfuscates the root cause of the issue, i.e. that the LocalExecutor
terminated. By catching EOFError, logging an error and exiting gracefully
we circumvent this issue.
