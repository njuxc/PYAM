[AIRFLOW-3139] include parameters into log.info in SQL operators, if any (#3986)

For all SQL-operators based on DbApiHook, sql command itself is printed
into log.info. But if parameters are used for the sql command, the
parameters would not be included in the printing. This makes the log
less useful.

This commit ensures that the parameters are also printed into the
log.info, if any.
