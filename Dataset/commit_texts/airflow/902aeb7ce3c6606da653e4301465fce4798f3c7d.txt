Fix DB session handling in XCom.set. (#18240)

Since the function has the `@provide_session` decorator it should not be
committing the session (the decorator handles that if it's not passed a
session) and nor should it be calling expunge_all -- that detaches all
objects from the session which is just not needed (or right) behaviour
form setting an XCom value.

By using the `session` fixture we get the transaction automatically
rolled back, so we don't need any setup/teardown methods
