Fix logging error with task error when JSON logging is enabled (#14456)

If the JSON logging mode for Elasticsearch logs is enabled, the
handle_failure function would fail, as it tried to treat the exception
object as the message and try to JSON serialize it (it expected a
string) -- which fails with:

```
TypeError: Object of type type is not JSON serializable
...
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/airflow/models/taskinstance.py", line 1150, in handle_failure
    self.log.exception(error)
...
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/airflow/utils/log/file_task_handler.py", line 63, in emit
    self.handler.emit(record)
```
