[AIRFLOW-3973] Commit after each alembic migration (#4797)

If `Variable`s are used in DAGs, and Postgres is used for the internal
database, a fresh `$ airflow initdb` (or `$ airflow resetdb`) spams the
logs with error messages (but does not fail).

This commit corrects this by running each migration in a separate
transaction.
