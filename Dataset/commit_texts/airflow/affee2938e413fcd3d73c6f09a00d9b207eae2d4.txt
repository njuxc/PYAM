Fix locking issue stopping tasks running with SequentialExecutor (#11797)

Missing a commit means that the the row level lock was not released
before `executor.heartbeat()` was called.  This was only a problem for
the SequentialExecutor, as all the other executors would continue
running the scheduler code so the lock would be released shortly after
tasks are sent to the executor anyway. (Where as SequentialExecutor
doesn't return control until tasks have run!)
