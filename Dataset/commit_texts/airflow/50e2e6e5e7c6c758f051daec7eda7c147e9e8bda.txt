Explain sentry default environment variable for subprocess hook (#18346)

* Explain sentry default environment variable for subprocess hook

Sentry by default monkey-patches standard library POpen function
to capture and pass current process' environment to subprocess
with `SUBPROCESS_` prefix. This break SubprocessHook tests
when sentry tests are run before SubprocessHook tests, and also
it modifies SubprocessHook behaviour (and promise) in production
environment as well.

This PR:

* adds documentation to both sentry documentation and the
  SubprocessHook documentation explaining the interaction between
  the two
* Adds documentation explaining how to disable this default
  Sentry behaviour
* disables default integrations in the Sentry tests to avoid
  side-effects

Fixes: #18268
