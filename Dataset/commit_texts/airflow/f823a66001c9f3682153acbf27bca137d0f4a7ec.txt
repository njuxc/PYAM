[AIRFLOW-3705] Fix PostgresHook get_conn to use conn_name_attr (#5841)

Update PostgresHook's get_conn method to directly call the specified
conn_name_attr rather that always using self.postgres_conn_id.

Currently subclassing PostgresHook requires overriding the
postgres_conn_id attribute in order to establish a separate connection.

Add an additional unit test for this case checking that the subclassed
PostgresHook's get_conn calls the correct arguments and that the hook
calls the correction connection_id in get_connection.
