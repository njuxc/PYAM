Display explicit error in case UID has no actual username (#15212)

Fixes #9963 : Don't require a current username

Previously, we used getpass.getuser() with no fallback, which errors out
if there is no username specified for the current UID (which happens a
lot more in environments like Docker & Kubernetes). This updates most
calls to use our own copy which has a fallback to return the UID as a
string if there is no username.
