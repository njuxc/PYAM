Bugfix: resources in `executor_config` breaks Graph View in UI (#15199)

closes https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/14327

When using `KubernetesExecutor` and the task as follows:

```python
PythonOperator(
    task_id=f"sync_{table_name}",
    python_callable=sync_table,
    provide_context=True,
    op_kwargs={"table_name": table_name},
    executor_config={"KubernetesExecutor": {"request_cpu": "1"}},
    retries=5,
    dag=dag,
)
```

it breaks the UI as settings resources in such a way is only there
for backwards compatibility.

This commits fixes it.
