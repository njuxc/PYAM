[AIRFLOW-738] Commit deleted xcom items before insert

A delete insert sequence within one transaction can lead
to a deadlocked transaction with Mariadb / MySQL.

The deletes, in case they affected no rows, all get a shared lock
(mode IX) on the end-of-table gap. Once the insert is executed,
the shared lock is still held by all threads,
and the insert intention waits for the release of this shared lock.

The solution is to not do the following in parallel:

1. Delete the rows you want to insert, when the rows aren't there.
2. Insert the rows

In this case the risk of not executing the delete and insert
is relatively low, as it was the users intention to run the
task. In case it fails in between the two transactions
the task can be tried.
