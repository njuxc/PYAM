Decode Remote Google Logs (#13115)

* decode remote google logs before returning

The `Blob.download_as_string` function returns a byte which cause
the log result to be displayed in a single line like:

b"line1\nline2"

instead of

line1
line2

added an isinstance check to make sure it doesn't break if it
returns string in some case and not others
