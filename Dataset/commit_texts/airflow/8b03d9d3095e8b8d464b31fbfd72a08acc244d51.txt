Fixed long delays in the Temporal trigger (#17564)

This trigger was never actually working for delays over two hours, as it
was comparing a Pendulum.Period to a datetime.datetime, in a way that
always returned True.

This commit fixes the behaviour. This unfortunately seems un-testable,
as it's not possible to interrupt asyncio's sleep() while it's
in-flight.
