CLI: Fail ``backfill`` command before loading DAGs if missing args (#18994)

I was looking through some of the CLI code last week trying to improve the speed of `airflow user` commands and I noticed this small issue. 

If neither the `start_date` or `end_date` argument is provided then the command will fail, but it will first parse all of the DAGs which can take up to several minutes in large deployments. 

Now the command will fail faster, allowing the user to adjust their command and retry.
