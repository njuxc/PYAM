Don't check execution_date in refresh_from_db (#16809)

The native sqlalchemy DateTime type does not compare well when timezones
don't match. This can happen if the current execution_date on a DagRun
instance is not in UTC (the db entry is always in UTC).

Since DagRun has a unique constraint on (dag_id, run_id), these two
should be able to return one unique result, and the executrion_date
column should not be needed anyway. Let's just remove that filter to
prevent all the datetime comparison trouble.
