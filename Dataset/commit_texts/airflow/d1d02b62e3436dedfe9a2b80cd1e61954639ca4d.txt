Switch to built-in data structures in SecretsMasker (#16424)

Using Iterable in SecretsMasker might cause undesireable
side effect in case the object passed as log parameter
is an iterable object and actually iterating it is not idempotent.

For example in case of botocore, it passes StreamingBody
object to log and this object is Iterable. However it can be
iterated only once. Masking causes the object to be iterated
during logging and results in empty body when actual results
are retrieved later.

This change only iterates list type of objects and recurrently
redacts only dicts/strs/tuples/sets/lists which should never
produce any side effects as all those objects do not have side
effects when they are accessed.
