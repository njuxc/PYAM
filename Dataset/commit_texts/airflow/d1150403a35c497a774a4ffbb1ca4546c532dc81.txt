Bugfix: ``TypeError`` when Serializing & sorting iterables (#15395)

This bug got introduced in #14909. Removed sorting from list and tuple as list & tuples preserve order unlike set.

The following DAG errors with: `TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'dict'`

```python
from airflow import models
from airflow.operators.dummy import DummyOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
params = {
    "staging_schema": [{"key:":"foo","value":"bar"},
                       {"key:":"this","value":"that"}]
}

with models.DAG(dag_id='test-dag',
                start_date=datetime(2019, 2, 14),
                schedule_interval='30 13 * * *',
                catchup=False,
                max_active_runs=1,
                params=params
                ) as dag:
    my_task = DummyOperator(
        task_id='task1'
    )
```

Full Error:

```
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/airflow/serialization/serialized_objects.py", line 210, in <dictcomp>
    return cls._encode({str(k): cls._serialize(v) for k, v in var.items()}, type_=DAT.DICT)
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/airflow/serialization/serialized_objects.py", line 212, in _serialize
    return sorted(cls._serialize(v) for v in var)
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'dict'
During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

```

This is because `sorted()` does not work with dict as it can't compare. Removed sorting from list & tuples which fixes it.
It also fails when we have set with multiple types.
