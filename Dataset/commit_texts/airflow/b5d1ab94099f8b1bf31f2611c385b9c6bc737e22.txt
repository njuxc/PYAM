Introduced deterministic order in connection export (#11670)

The tests for connection export failed when CLI tests are
run in isolation. The problem was with non-deterministic
sequence of returned rows from connection export query.

Rather than fixing the test to accept the non-deterministic
sequence, it is better idea to return them always in the
connection_id order. This does not change functionality and
is backwards compatible, but at the same time it gives stability
in the export, which might be important if someone uses export
to determine for example if some connections were added/removed.
