BugFix: Null execution date on insert to ``task_fail`` violating NOT NULL (#18979)

Fixes #18943 null exec date on insert to task_fail

The dag_run property isn't populated by refresh_from_db or when this is
called from the failure handler when reaping zombies. This resulted in
an IntegrityError violating the NOT NULL constraint on task_fail
