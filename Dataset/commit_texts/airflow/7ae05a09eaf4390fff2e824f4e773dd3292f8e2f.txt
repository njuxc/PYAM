[AIRFLOW-5354] Reduce scheduler CPU usage from 100% (#7552)

A previous change ended up with the scheduler busily checking if the
DagFDagFileProcessorAgent had collected any dags. This simple change
takes the CPU usage of the scheduler from an entire core, to barely
anything (dropped below 5%).

Time for 10 dag runs of 9 dags with 108 total tasks: 50.3581s (±9.538s)
vs master of Time for 10 dag runs of 9 dags with 108 total tasks: 49.6910s (±7.193s)

The change is is basically no overall change, and is a quick fix for
now, and bigger changes are in store around DAG parsing anyway.
