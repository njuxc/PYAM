[AIRFLOW-2190] Fix TypeError when returning 404 (#4596)

When processing HTTP response headers, gunicorn checks that the name of each
header is a string. Here's the relevant gunicorn code:

From gunicorn/http/wsgi.py, line 257

    def process_headers(self, headers):
        for name, value in headers:
            if not isinstance(name, string_types):
                raise TypeError('%r is not a string' % name)

In Python3, `string_types` is set to the built-in `str`. For Python 2,
it's set to `basestring`. Again, the relevant gunicorn code:

From gunicorn/six.py, line 38:

    if PY3:
        string_types = str,
        ...
    else:
        string_types = basestring,

On Python2 the `b''` syntax returns a `str`, but in Python3 it returns `bytes`.
`bytes` != `str`, so we get the following error when returning a 404 on
Python3:

    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/airflow/www/app.py", line 166, in root_app
    resp(b'404 Not Found', [(b'Content-Type', b'text/plain')])
    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/gunicorn/http/wsgi.py", line 261, in start_response
    self.process_headers(headers)
    File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/gunicorn/http/wsgi.py", line 268, in process_headers
    raise TypeError('%r is not a string' % name)
    TypeError: b'Content-Type' is not a string

Dropping the `b` prefix in favor of the single-quote string syntax should work
for both Python2 and 3, as demonstrated below:
