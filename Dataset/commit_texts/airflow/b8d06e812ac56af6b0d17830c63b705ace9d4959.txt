Fix KubernetesPodOperator reattach when not deleting pods (#18070)

This change:

- ignores any pods already marked as complete instead of trying to
  reattach to them.
- properly marks all 'finished' unsuccessful pods that won't
  be deleted.

Combined, these allow `is_delete_operator_pod=False` and
`reattach_on_restart=True` to function together properly during retries.
