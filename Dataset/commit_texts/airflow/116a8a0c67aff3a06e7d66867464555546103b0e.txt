Remove duplicate call to sync_metadata inside DagFileProcessorManager (#15121)

`_process_message` already calls sync_metadata if it's a DagParsingStat,
so there's no need to call it again.  This isn't expensive, but no point
doing it

I've also added a runtime check to ensure this function is only used in
sync mode, which makes the purpose/logic used in this function clearer.
