[AIRFLOW-809][AIRFLOW-1] Use __eq__ ColumnOperator When Testing Booleans

The .is_ ColumnOperator causes the SqlAlchemy's
MSSQL dialect to produce
IS 0 when given a value of False rather than a
value of None. The __eq__
ColumnOperator does this same test with the added
benefit that it will
modify the resulting expression from and == to a
IS NULL when the target
is None.

This change replaces all is_ ColumnOperators that
are doing boolean
comparisons and leaves all is_ ColumnOperators
that are checking for
None values.

Closes #2022 from gritlogic/AIRFLOW-809
