Cloudformation info checkmode (#65958)

* set supports_check_mode=True

I don't see any reason why this module cannot run in check mode.  The following API calls are made, none of which modify configurations

All using boto3.client('cloudformation')
describe_change_set
describe_stacks
describe_stack_events
get_paginator
get_stack_policy
get_template
list_change_sets
list_stack_resources

* duplicate cloudformation_info tasks with checkmode

Duplicated all existing cloudformation_info tests and added check_mode: yes to them

* delete duplicate empty line
