[unarchive] work on older RHEL with group: <gid> (#72098)

Change:
- No longer fail due to old Fedora/RHEL and our failure to try to cast
  gids to integers before trying to pass them to getgrgid() before
  trying to use them.
- Add tests for user/mode for various unarchive formats.

Test Plan:
- New integration tests, ran against centos6 container

Tickets:
- Fixes #71903
