Filter DNSimple request by record name. (#49981)

* Filter DNSimple request by record name.

The request was not filtered and DNSimple returns only the first 100
records so if the number of records is larger the check could fail.

This patch fixes the issue and also makes the check to perform better.

* Add changelog fragment.
