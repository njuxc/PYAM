rabbitmq_binding: Fix using empty routing key (#48597)

* rabbitmq_binding: Fix using empty routing key

If the routing key is an empty string we need to use the special props
value ~ in the URL. Otherwise the last part of the URL will be empty,
which will instead be equivalent to the "list all bindings" API call
which always returns 200 OK (as long as the exchange and queue exists).

* rabbitmq_binding: Move routing_key test outside format

Test the routing_key value and set the props value outside the format
call. We leave the original routing_key untouched since its original
value is later needed in create().
