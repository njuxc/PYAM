Fix zip content filtering in unarchive module (#76069)

When we introduced an include parameter to the unarchive module, we
inadvertenly flipped the exclusion logic. This flip meant that the
unarchive module started rejecting files that should be extracted.

This commit flips the bad logic and adds some tests that will make
sure things do not go bad again.
