Fix iosxr netconf plugin response namespace (#49238)

* Fix iosxr netconf plugin response namespace

*  iosxr netconf plugin removes namespace by default
   for all the responses as parsing of xml is easier
   without namepsace in iosxr module. However to validate
   the response received from device against yang model requires
   namespace to be present in resposne.
*  Add a parameter in iosxr netconf plugin to control if namespace
   should be removed from response or not.

* Fix CI issues

* Fix review comment
