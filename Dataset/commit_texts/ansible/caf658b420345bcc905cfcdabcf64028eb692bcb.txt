Fix bugs in softlayer dynamic inventory (#28178)

* --host hostname did not work due to calling wrong function

* softlayer api returns a bunch of extra stuff in the tagReference dict that
  makes --list output crazy long, like over a terminal buffer for just one server
  this culls out the extranneous information and only inserts the actual user
  provided tags to each server.
