Correct usage of sorted() in mongodb_user (#46792)

* Correct usage of sorted() in mongodb_user

sorted() can't be called on a list of dicts
without supplying a key parameter. This is
explained really well in the Sorting HOWTO
https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/sorting.html#key-functions

This commit fixes #46791

* Fix PEP8 issues
