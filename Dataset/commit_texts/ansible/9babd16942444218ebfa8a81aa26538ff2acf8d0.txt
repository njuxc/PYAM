k8s handle absent resources when waiting (#51682)

* k8s wait - don't try to call to_dict on None

Need to ensure that the resource dict is correctly returned for absent
resources

* Cope with resources without a namespace

Some resources (e.g. ClusterRoleBinding) do not have a Namespace.
Handle the lack of a namespace key.
