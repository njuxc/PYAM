uri: check unexpected failure doesn't occur when file cannot be saved (#45824)

* uri: fix TypeError when file can't be saved

Fix the following exception (and others):

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/home/lilou/debug_dir/__main__.py", line 604, in <module>
        main()
      File "/home/lilou/debug_dir/__main__.py", line 554, in main
        write_file(module, url, dest, content, resp)
      File "/home/lilou/debug_dir/__main__.py", line 320, in write_file
        module.fail_json(msg="Destination dir '%s' not writable" % os.path.dirname(dest), **resp)
    TypeError: fail_json() got multiple values for keyword argument 'msg'

I would rather remove **resp from returned values but this module is
flagged as stableinterface.

* Static imports are more straight forward and preferred unless dynamic inclusion is required.
